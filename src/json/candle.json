    "How Does It Work": "For optimum use and to prevent wax tunnelling, burn the candle until the wax has melted and pooled to the edge. Use the lid to extinguish the flame. Allow candle to solidify before re-lighting. Trim the wick between uses, ensuring it is no longer than ¼ inch/6mm. Protect the surface on which the candle rests. Do not burn for longer than 1 – 1 ½ hours at a time. Do not leave unattended or within reach of children or pets."
